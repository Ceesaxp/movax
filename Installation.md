# This page outlines installation process #

Once you have obtained Mueller Dictionary it would be nice to actually be able to use it.  Luckily, this is an extremely simple process.

  * Unpack the archive somewhere -- either double-click on it and let Mac do little BomArchiver magic, or open up terminal and execute

```
tar xzf mueller-<version>.tgz
```

  * The above step will produce two objects: an `INSTALL` file and `MuellerEnglishRussian.dictionary`. Drag the latter to `~/Library/Dictionaries` folder on your Mac.
  * Start Dictionary.app and enjoy your newly-added dictionary!
