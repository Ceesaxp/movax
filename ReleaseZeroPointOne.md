# What's included #

This is the initial, binary-only release of Mueller English-Russian dictionary.  This is a _preview only_ release, it is by no means final.


# Known Issues #

  * This dictionary includes 45,540 terms, not the entire 45,955 terms as is in original.  This is due to some formatting quirks that are not handled well (yet) by conversion script.
  * Article layouts are very preliminary and look ugly.
  * Functional terms (e.g. part of speech designations, abbreviations, etc) are not processed yet and are shown verbatim.
  * Front/back matter is not added
